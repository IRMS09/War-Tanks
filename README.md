# War-Tanks
This is a Python game developed using a graphics library for a university project.
The game features a map with two players, represented by a blue tank and a red tank. In this scenario, both players face each other in a battle for supremacy.

The game includes two tanks, one red and one blue; three obstacles—a stone in the upper-left corner, another in the lower-right corner, and a destroyed tank in the center; and twelve HUD elements, consisting of three hearts per player to represent health and three ammunition cartridges per player to indicate the number of remaining shots.

Additionally, there are two collectible items: one that restores health and another that grants two additional shots to the current magazine.

That’s it—I hope you enjoy playing!
